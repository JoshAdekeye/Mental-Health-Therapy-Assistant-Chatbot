    "## Introduction\n",
    "<a id='Introduction'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "In an era where mental health awareness is increasing, there is a need for accessible and immediate support systems. This project focuses on developing a chatbot that provides mental health support, offering coping mechanisms, mindfulness exercises, and emergency contacts, tailored to the user's emotional state and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "> Target Audience: Individuals seeking immediate mental health support, therapists, and mental health organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Impact: The chatbot aims to offer first-line support, guide individuals to appropriate resources, and potentially reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health care.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Market Trends: Growing integration of AI in mental health services and the rising demand for digital mental health solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "> Develop a chatbot that can understand and respond to mental health-related inquiries empathetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Utilize therapeutic conversation datasets and mental health FAQs for informed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Implement sentiment analysis for mood assessment and provide tailored advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Deploy the chatbot as an accessible digital tool for immediate mental health support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "<a id='Data-Collection-and-Preparation'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "> Mental Health Conversational Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can be used to train a model for a chatbot that can behave like a therapist in order to provide emotional support to people with anxiety & depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains intents. An “intent” is the intention behind a user's message. For instance, If I were to say “I am sad” to the chatbot, the intent, in this case, would be “sad”. Depending upon the intent, there is a set of Patterns and Responses appropriate for the intent. Patterns are some examples of a user’s message which aligns with the intent while Responses are the replies that the chatbot provides in accordance with the intent. Various intents are defined and their patterns and responses are used as the model’s training data to identify a particular intent\n",
    "\n",
    "> Mental Health FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of FAQs about Mental Health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development of AI Models\n",
    "<a id='Development-of-AI-Models'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Implementing sentiment analysis to understand the user’s emotional state.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using NLP for empathetic and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Developing decision trees to guide the chatbot's advice pathways."

On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life.

Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.\"]},\n",

Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions.

      "FAQ response: It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child’s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs).\n"
